***MapMan***  
A sample program that scrapes addresses from the internet. Then converts those addresses into coordinates and visualizes coordinates on a map.  
  
*Important things to note before using the code*  
*The program will prompt for a location, contact a web service and retrieve JSON for the web service and parse that data, and retrieve the first place_id from the JSON. A place ID is a textual identifier that uniquely identifies a place as within Google Maps.  
*Please run your program to find the place_id for this location: Vilnius Gediminas Technical University  
*Make sure to enter the name and case exactly as above and enter the place_id and your Python code below. Hint: The first seven characters of the place_id are "ChIJU_B ..."  
*Make sure to retreive the data from the URL specified above and not the normal Google API. Your program should work with the Google API - but the place_id may not match for this assignment.
